# This scripts assumes it is being executed in emscripten environment, where
# emcc and other emscripten variables are used. In order to ease up the things
# I have created a docker with emscripten environment. Docker image is available
# as psych0der/emscripten and can be used by `docker pull psych0der/emscripten`

# install libpng-dev16. Installing libpng-dev16 is important since we are going
# to link our compiled pngquant static lib with libpng compiled for emscripten by
# emscripten folks. They are using libpng-16 so its emperative to use this version
# when linking the header files to avoid disparities later

# apt-get install -y libpng16-dev

# start configuring script

# At this point just make sure that config.mk file points correct version of
# libpng

emmake make

# pngquant Makefile is configured to create executable by the name of pngquant
# But since we are using emscripten the file actually creted is bitecode file.
# So we need to rename it
